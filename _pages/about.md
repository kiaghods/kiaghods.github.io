I am a second-year undergraduate at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University </a>, studying cs + math. I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning, mathematics, and cognitive science. 

I am a researcher in Princeton's <a href="https://pli.princeton.edu/"> Princeton Language and Intelligence Initiative </a>, where I work on mechanistic interpretability and alignment of large language models and vision-language models. I am advised by Professors <a href="https://jdc.princeton.edu/"> Jon Cohen </a> and <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php"> Tom Griffiths </a>.

At Princeton, I am President of Princeton's <a href="https://princeton.acm.org/">ACM chapter</a>, Officer of <a href="https://www.aiatprinceton.com/aitt">AI@Princeton</a>, and a member/co-organizer of various machine learning related reading groups. I previously interned at Hillspire and have worked at early-stage startups (i.e., <a href="https://www.astralis.sh/">Astralis</a>).

Outside of academics, I am an avid fan of both playing and watching basketball and tennis. I also enjoy reading and writing.

You can reach me at `[x] at princeton dot edu` where `[x] = kia.ghods`.
